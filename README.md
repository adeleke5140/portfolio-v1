# portfolio-v1

This is the start of my portofolio. I have always wanted to have one. I couldn't because I didn't have a design. Now, I've got one from an amazing designer and I'm excited.

I am going to document as I go. It is important to take stock of what's going on, challenges I run into and new technologies I will implement.I don't have an estimate on how long it's going to take but it is gonna be exciting. My website is also going to be accessible -- that is a priority for me.

For my HTML strucuture, I do not want a build step so I am using just HTML. CSS has come a long way but SCSS is still pretty useful; I will be using it as well. JS, absolutely as well as the Javascript animation library GSAP. Thanks to Cassidoo, Seyi and Judah.
